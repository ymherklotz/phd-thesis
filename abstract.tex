\addchap{Abstract}

Latency, throughput, and energy efficiency are becoming increasingly important,
leading to custom hardware accelerators being designed for numerous applications
instead of using less efficient general processors.  Alas, designing these
accelerators can be an error-prone process, especially when using
\glspl{HDL} such as Verilog, which operate at the register transfer
level.

An attractive alternative is \emph{\gls{HLS}}, where hardware designs are
automatically compiled from software written in a high-level language like C.
This way, hardware designers can benefit from mature software development tools.  \gls{HLS} tools promise
designs with comparable performance and energy-efficiency to those hand-written
in \glspl{HDL}, reducing the time needed to design new accelerators.  Reasoning about behaviour at a higher level should also make the process
less error-prone.  Unfortunately, \gls{HLS} tools are
unreliable; Vivado HLS produces incorrect designs in 1.2\% of randomly generated
C programs, undermining testing performed at the higher level of
abstraction.

In an attempt to improve this situation, I propose a formally verified \gls{HLS}
tool called Vericert, providing a computer-checked proof that ensures it only
generates hardware designs that behave like the input software program.
Vericert extends CompCert, an established formally verified C Compiler, with a
hardware back-end.

One expects a verified tool to produce significantly worse hardware than
existing optimising \gls{HLS} tools, as each transformation has to be simple
enough to be proven correct.  Indeed, an initial version of Vericert was up to $8\times$ slower than a state-of-the-art \gls{HLS} tool
called Bambu.  However, by verifying
\emph{hyperblock scheduling} in Vericert, a transformation which parallelises instructions in regions of code without loops, hardware produced by
Vericert becomes only $1.6\times$ slower than Bambu without optimisations
and $3.6\times$ slower than optimised Bambu.  This is
encouraging, showing that a verified \gls{HLS} tool is comparable with an
existing \gls{HLS} tool, while being
guaranteed to generate correct hardware designs.
